if you want to preserve the settings of /etc/resolve.conf (not to be overwitten by dhclient) , 
then edit the file /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcg-eth0 and set PEER DNS = no . 

The resolv.conf file can also be deployed through puppet to have the desired ipv4 name servers addresses, 
and that is the current case.
